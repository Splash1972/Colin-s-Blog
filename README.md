I'm attempting to build this two-page site from scratch.  I will need to resourse the files and activities used in class, but my goal is to as much of this on my own. 

I have, however, scheduled a meeting with a tutor, so I will update this accordingly to reflect any help I'm very likely going to use here.

After a successful meeting with Sandra Smith, I was able to get the data to local storage.  I fought for quite a while to get it to display properly.  

At first, it was showing the entire array with brackets and all... but finally, with the help of https://www.w3schools.com/, I was able to format it finally.  I would prefer to style it differently, but I, at the advice of the instructor, need to move on to other projects/homework.  

It may not be pretty, but it works.
